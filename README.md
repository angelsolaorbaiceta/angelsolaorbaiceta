### ðŸ“– I Wrote A Book

I wrote a book for engineering students (with a background in mechanics) to learn how to write Python programs to solve complex engineering problems.
You can check out all the details in the [book's website](https://www.hardcoreprogramming.dev/).
You can already buy it from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hardcore-programming-mechanical-engineers) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Programming-Engineers-Angel-Sola/dp/1718500785).

The source code for the book is open source and you can find it in my [Mechanics repository](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/Mechanics).

### ðŸ”­ Currently Working

I'm spending my time mainly working on [InkStructure](https://www.inkstructure.com/); a powerful and easy-to-use 2D Structural Analysis desktop application especially designed for the engineering and architecture modern student.
I open sourced part of the code in _InkStructure_, you can read [more about it here](https://www.inkstructure.com/open-source).

Here's the screenshot of the current progress rendering the deformed structure:
