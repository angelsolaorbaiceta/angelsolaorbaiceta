### 📖 Build your own frontend framework

You can now purchase my new book: _Build a frontend framework (from scratch)_.
In this book, I teach you how to __build your own frontend framework__, line by line, so that you can learn how they work internally.

### 📖 Solve engineering problems using Python

I wrote a book for engineering students (with a background in mechanics) to learn how to write Python programs to solve complex engineering problems.
You can check out all the details in the [book's website](https://www.hardcoreprogramming.dev/).
You can already buy it from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/hardcore-programming-mechanical-engineers) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Programming-Engineers-Angel-Sola/dp/1718500785).

The source code for the book is open source and you can find it in my [Mechanics repository](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/Mechanics).

If you read it and you liked it, I'd love if you could write me a nice review in Amazon.
Thanks!
