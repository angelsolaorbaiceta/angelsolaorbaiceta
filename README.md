# Product-Minded Engineer

I'm Angel, a product-minded and security-aware full-stack engineer with more than 10 years of experience writing software for the web (both frontend and backend) and the desktop.
I've developed desktop applications for MacOS (native; Swift) and Windows (Winforms and WPF), CLIs using Go, Python and JS, as well as frontends (vanilla JS, Vue, Angular, React, and my own framework—see books below) and backends (Java, Kotlin, JS and Go).
I played around a bit with Cocoa Touch for iOS, and some Android as well, but haven't done anything meaningful for mobile.

🖥️ The passion to solve real people's problems using technology drives me.

🌱 Currently learning low-level systems programming (mostly for Linux) and network protocols.

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time I love cooking food from all over the world. I have my own hot chili trees planted at home.


## 📖 Books

I'm no writer, but I wrote two books you might be interested in.

### Build a frontend framework (from scratch)

In this book, I teach you how to __build your own frontend framework__, line by line, so that you can learn how they work internally.

📘 Buy your copy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Frontend-Web-Framework-Scratch/dp/1633438066) or [the publisher](http://mng.bz/aM2o).

📦 Here's the [repository with the code](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/fe-fwk-book).



### Hardcore programming for mechanical engineers

A book for engineering students (with a background in mechanics) to learn how to write Python programs to solve complex engineering problems.
You'll learn how to program a 2D geometry library, a vector graphics engine and how to create CLIs to put everything together.
You can check out all the details in the [book's website](https://www.hardcoreprogramming.dev/).

📘 Buy your copy [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Programming-Engineers-Angel-Sola/dp/1718500785) or [the publisher](https://nostarch.com/hardcore-programming-mechanical-engineers).

📦 Here's the [repository with the code](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/Mechanics).

If you read any of them and like it, I'd love if you could write me a nice review in Amazon.
It means a lot for a noob author like myself.
Thanks!
