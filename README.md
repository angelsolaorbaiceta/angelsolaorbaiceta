# Product-Minded Engineer

I'm Angel, a product-minded and security-aware full-stack engineer with more than 10 years of experience writing software for the web (both frontend and backend) and the desktop.
Currently learning low-level systems programming (mostly for Linux) and network protocols.

I can work proficiently with the following programming languages:

- Go
- Kotlin
- Python
- Javascript & Typescript


## ðŸ“– Books

I'm no writer, but I wrote two books you might be interested in.

### Build a frontend framework (from scratch)

In this book, I teach you how to __build your own frontend framework__, line by line, so that you can learn how they work internally.

ðŸ“˜ Buy your copy from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Frontend-Web-Framework-Scratch/dp/1633438066) or [the publisher](http://mng.bz/aM2o).

ðŸ“¦ [Here's the repository with the code](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/fe-fwk-book).



### Hardcore programming for mechanical engineers

A book for engineering students (with a background in mechanics) to learn how to write Python programs to solve complex engineering problems.
You'll learn how to program a 2D geometry library, a vector graphics engine and how to create CLIs to put everything together.
You can check out all the details in the [book's website](https://www.hardcoreprogramming.dev/).

ðŸ“˜ Buy your copy [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hardcore-Programming-Engineers-Angel-Sola/dp/1718500785) or [the publisher](https://nostarch.com/hardcore-programming-mechanical-engineers).

ðŸ“¦ [Here's the repository with the code](https://github.com/angelsolaorbaiceta/Mechanics).

If you read any of them and like it, I'd love if you could write me a nice review in Amazon.
It means a lot for a noob author like myself.
Thanks!
